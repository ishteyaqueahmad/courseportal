# Courseportal
This project aims at creating a Courses portal for a campus/organization. This allows registered users of the system to join a course available in the site and access the materials published for the course. People can register themselves as students of a course or Faculty for a course. When a person registers himself as a Faculty, an approval mechanism should be triggered which sends an email to the Administrator for approving the person as a Faculty. There will be an admin approval page where admin can approve the faculty members for the course.

## Number of Modules:
The system after careful analysis has been identified to be presented with the following modules:
1.	Authentication and Security Module.
2.	Admin Module.
3.	Faculty Module.
4.	Student Module.
5.	Exam Management Module.
6.	Material and Announcement Management Module.
